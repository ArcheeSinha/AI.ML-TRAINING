# Hello, World! 🚀  

Welcome to my **AI/ML Training Journey**! 🎉  

This is where I document my learning process, assignments, and experiments as I dive deeper into the world of **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**.  

## 📌 What's in This Repo?  
- My **assignments** 📚  
- Notes and insights from my training sessions 📝  
- Cool projects I’m working on 💡  
- Random AI/ML experiments because curiosity is key! 🔍  

## 🚀 Why This Repo?  
I believe in **learning by doing**, and this is my little space on the internet where I track my progress, share what I learn, and maybe even help someone else along the way.  

Feel free to explore, learn with me, and drop any suggestions if you have them! 🚀
